This is a roguelike game currently called 'Squad' that shall be my entry into this year's itch.io 7DRL game jam.
The player will manage a party of adventurers whose goal is to descend into the 10th (subject to change) level of the dungeon, retrieve the McGuffin (name subject to change), and escape with it, in classic Rogue/Nethack fashion. The main focus will be on party management rather than on each individual turn.

See DEVLOG.md for more details on mechanics and goals.
